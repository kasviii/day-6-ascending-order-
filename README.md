This Python program takes an array of numbers as input from the user and determines whether it's sorted in ascending order (from smallest to largest).

Here's how it works:

You'll be asked to enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces. For example, you could type: 1 5 2 8 4

The program will then check each number in the list to see if it's bigger than the number before it.

If all the numbers are in ascending order, the program will tell you that the array is sorted and accordingly comment true.

If any numbers are out of order, the program will let you know that the array isn't sorted and accordingluy comment false.
